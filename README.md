# introduction-lower version
UV has a major advantage in its speed compared with other old packege managers such as pip or conda
however,it also has some disadvantage : 
1. you cannot create virtual env by name -they must be created in each project 
2. it lacks tools for managing multiple virturl environments easily
3. based on those reason, i designed extensions

# advanced phrase
UV offers exceptional speed compared to traditional package managers like pip and conda.
However, it has limitations — for example, it does not support managing virtual environments by name or handling multiple environments centrally.
To address these issues, I developed an extension inspired by Conda’s environment management.
